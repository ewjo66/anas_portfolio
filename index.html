                <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p>As the youngest member of chefATL's marketing team, I quickly learned how much responsibility can shape resilience and creativity. Leading cross-department projects as the Assistant Creative Director and helping bring a SCAD docu-series to life gave me a sense of confidence that I carried into every role that followed; whether guiding a 20-person SCADpro team in a BMW mixed-reality collaboration, driving community-focused storytelling as Director of Strategy and Copywriting for The Salvation Army, or designing a TSA Real ID campaign with Deloitte. Each experience has deepened my belief in the power of adaptability and leadership.</p>
                
                <p>That belief is rooted in my family story. As a first-generation Mexican-American, I grew up admiring my parents' courage in starting over in a new country, leaving their families behind to give my brother and me opportunities they never had. My father's determination to climb the career ladder moved us from small-town McAllen, Texas, to new horizons, while my mother's resilience allowed her to learn a new language and build a life across Texas, South Carolina, and Georgia, all while raising two children. Their example taught me that strength is measured not by perfection, but by persistence and the willingness to embrace every challenge.</p>
                
                <p>It's why I hold close a quote that was once shared with me by a mentor: "A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one." I've come to see myself as that "jack of all trades", a creative strategist and art director who thrives at the intersection of disciplines. My fluency in both art direction and strategic writing, paired with my ability to lead cross-functional teams, allows me to bridge gaps between strategy and storytelling, vision and execution.</p>
                
                <p>Now, as I pursue my M.A. in Strategic Communication at the University of North Carolina, I continue to expand my expertise in analytics, strategic writing, and communication research. My goal is to build on both my creative foundation and my family's legacy of resilience to become a strategist who helps brands connect authentically and deliver campaigns that are inclusive and impactful.</p>
